## Coding Principles for Symphony Dynamic Solver (If Generating Code Snippets or Debugging)

1.  **Simplicity & Clarity:** Code generated or analyzed should be straightforward and easy to understand.
2.  **DRY Principle:** Avoid redundancy in proposed solutions or fixes.
3.  **Environment Awareness:** Account for environment specifics if relevant to the problem.
4.  **Scope Discipline:** Focus analysis and solutions strictly on the defined problem scope.
5.  **Pattern Consistency:** Align with established coding patterns if analyzing existing code.
6.  **Modularity:** Solutions involving code should favor modular design.
7.  **Configuration Safety:** Be extremely cautious if the problem involves sensitive configurations.
8.  **Testing Rigor:** If debugging, ensure the proposed fix works for provided test cases and consider edge cases.
9.  **Impact Analysis:** When proposing code changes, briefly consider potential side effects.
10. **Documentation & Logging:** All reasoning, tool interactions, analysis steps, diagrams (Mermaid), and the final solution MUST be meticulously documented in the designated log and report files (`problem-solving/`). Logs are append-only and timestamped. Include summaries.
