# Product Requirements Document: Imgenhancify Frontend

## 1. Project Overview and Purpose

**Project Overview:**
The Imgenhancify Frontend is a web application designed to provide users with advanced image enhancement capabilities. It allows users to upload their images, apply various enhancement workflows powered by AI backend services, and compare the original and enhanced results. The application aims to offer a seamless and intuitive user experience for improving image quality.

**Main Goals:**

- Provide an easy-to-use interface for uploading and managing images.
- Offer powerful image enhancement features through integration with AI services like Fal.ai and Runpod (ComfyUI).
- Allow users to track the progress of image enhancement jobs.
- Enable users to compare original and enhanced images side-by-side.
- Ensure secure user authentication and management of user-specific data.

## 2. Key Features and Functionalities

- **User Authentication:**
  - User Sign-up: New users can create an account.
  - User Login: Existing users can log in to access their dashboard and features.
  - Session Management: Securely manage user sessions.
- **Image Upload:**
  - Users can upload images from their local devices.
  - Support for common image formats (e.g., JPG, PNG).
- **Image Enhancement:**
  - Integration with multiple AI-powered image enhancement providers (e.g., Fal.ai, Runpod with ComfyUI).
  - Support for different enhancement workflows (e.g., upscaling, noise reduction, detail enhancement).
  - Selection of enhancement parameters or workflows by the user (potential future feature).
- **Job Polling and Status Updates:**
  - Asynchronous processing of image enhancement requests.
  - Real-time or near real-time polling for job status updates.
  - Display of processing status to the user (e.g., "processing", "completed", "failed").
- **Results Display and Comparison:**
  - Display of the original uploaded image.
  - Display of the enhanced image once processing is complete.
  - Side-by-side comparison view for original and enhanced images.
- **Image Management:**
  - Users can view a gallery or list of their uploaded and enhanced images.
  - Users can delete their images.
- **Theme Customization:**
  - Light/Dark mode toggle for user interface preference.

## 3. Application Flow

1.  **Landing/Login:**
    - New users are directed to the Sign-up page or can navigate to it.
    - Existing users can navigate to the Login page.
    - Upon successful login/sign-up, users are redirected to the main application dashboard.
2.  **Image Upload:**
    - On the dashboard or a dedicated upload page, the user selects an image for upload.
    - The image is uploaded to the server.
3.  **Enhancement Process:**
    - After upload, the user can initiate the enhancement process (or it starts automatically).
    - The frontend sends a request to the backend API to start the enhancement job with the selected provider/workflow.
    - The frontend starts polling the backend API for the status of the enhancement job.
    - The UI updates to show the current status (e.g., "Enhancing...", "Queued...").
4.  **Viewing Results:**
    - Once the enhancement job is complete, the frontend retrieves the enhanced image.
    - The UI displays both the original and the enhanced image, potentially in a comparison view.
    - The user can download the enhanced image (potential future feature).
5.  **Managing Images:**
    - Users can navigate to a gallery or list view to see all their processed images.
    - Users can select an image to view its details or delete it.

## 4. High-Level Technical Architecture

- **Framework:** Next.js (React) for server-side rendering, client-side navigation, and API routes.
- **UI Components:**
  - Reusable UI components built with React, potentially using a library like Shadcn/UI (implied by `components.json` and typical Next.js setups).
  - Located in `frontend/src/components/ui/` and feature-specific components in `frontend/src/components/features/`.
- **State Management:**
  - Zustand for managing global application state (e.g., authentication status, image upload progress, image data). Store modules located in `frontend/src/lib/store/`.
- **Styling:**
  - Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
  - Global styles defined in `frontend/src/app/globals.css`.
- **Frontend API Routes:**
  - Located in `frontend/src/app/api/`.
  - Handle client requests for authentication, image uploading, initiating enhancement, polling status, and deleting images.
  - These routes interact with backend services or the database.
- **Service Layer:**
  - Located in `frontend/src/services/`.
  - `ImageEnhancementFactory.ts`: Selects the appropriate image enhancement provider.
  - `ImageEnhancementProvider.ts` (interface) and implementations (`FalAIProvider.ts`, `RunpodComfyUIProvider.ts`): Abstract communication with different AI backend services.
  - `PollingProvider.ts` (interface) and implementations (`FalPollingProvider.ts`, `RunpodPollingProvider.ts`): Manage status polling for enhancement jobs.
  - Specific ComfyUI workflows are defined in `frontend/src/services/image-enhancement/workflows/`.
- **Data Flow:**
  1.  User interacts with UI components.
  2.  UI components dispatch actions to Zustand stores or call functions that trigger API requests to frontend API routes.
  3.  Frontend API routes process requests, potentially calling external AI services via the service layer or interacting with the database.
  4.  Zustand stores are updated with new data/status.
  5.  UI components re-render based on changes in props or store state.
- **Database Integration:**
  - Prisma ORM for database interactions (schema defined in `frontend/prisma/schema.prisma`).
  - Likely used for storing user accounts, image metadata (references to stored images, enhancement status, user associations).
- **Authentication:**
  - Handled via API routes (`frontend/src/app/api/auth/`) and client-side logic (`frontend/src/app/actions/auth.ts`, `frontend/src/lib/store/authStore.ts`).
- **Error Handling & Utilities:**
  - Utility functions in `frontend/src/lib/utils.ts`.
  - Custom hooks like `useImagePolling.ts` for managing specific UI logic.
