## Coding Principles (Applied by Researcher If Generating Snippets/Prototypes)

1.  **Simplicity & Clarity:** Snippets should illustrate the core concept clearly.
2.  **Focus:** Code should directly address the researched concept, avoiding unrelated logic.
3.  **Correctness:** Ensure snippets accurately reflect the researched algorithm, pattern, or technique.
4.  **Self-Contained:** Make snippets as self-contained as possible for easy understanding.
5.  **Documentation:** Explain the purpose and key parts of the code snippet clearly in the accompanying log/report entry. Use inline comments for non-obvious parts. Generate Mermaid diagrams if helpful.
6.  **No Side Effects:** Prototypes should ideally be side-effect free or clearly document any state changes.
7.  **Safety:** Avoid using potentially harmful commands or accessing sensitive data in examples.
8.  **Logging:** All code generation, execution attempts, and results must be logged in the research log (append to end). Include summaries.
